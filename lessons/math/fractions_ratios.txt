Teacher: Let's say you are about to play outside, and your mom wants to pour you some lemonade. What if she only has really big cups? You don't want to carry around a heavy cup with a lot of lemonade you won't drink, do you?
Student: no.
Teacher: But you don't want to run out of lemonade when you are still playing either. 
Student: no.
Teacher: So, how do we measure how full the cup is?
Student: I don't know.
Teacher: Well, one way you could do that is by looking at how tall the lemonade inside the cup is.
Student: What?
Teacher: If you look at the side of the cup when it has lemonade in it, you can look at how high the lemonade goes, and compare it to how high the cup goes. 
Student: okay.
Teacher: If the height of the lemonade is right in the middle between the bottom and the top of the cup, we call that a half, or 1/2. 
Student: I don't understand.
Teacher: We call it 1/2 or one out of two because if you had the same amount in another cup and you then pour the second cup into the first one, you would add the 1/2 with the 1/2 and get 2/2, since the first cup can fit two halves.
